Efforts to analyze data and model spread of COVID-19, focusing on the US

This represents an individual effort to explore avenues to:

1. Monitor available data on CoronaVirus spread, focusing now on the US, 
at the highest available data resolution. 
2. Statistically model the current and potential future spread or 
abatement of the pandemic based on various assumptions and possible actions.
3. Computationally model the same.
4. Explore possiblities for more rapidly informing action via improved data streams on the
spread of the virus, for example utilizing pre-confirmation symptom data capture
using unconventional means (public surveys, reporting from clinics on call volumes,
online screening tools, etc.); utilizing mobility data to assess effectiveness of
social distancing and mobility-limiting actions, e.g. from cell phone tracking
aggregate datasets.
